# The Woodpecker Makery's ZeLDA Layout for Planck Keyboards

The ZeLDA (Zero-Look-Down Access) Layout is a minimalist approach to
keyboarding.  The philsophy is that you should never have to reach
more than one key adjacent.  It's still a QWERTY, but seriously
improved.

See the [2017 Open Source Bridge session](http://opensourcebridge.org/sessions/1988) and [slides](https://www.slideshare.net/secret/3oeMZCprt1mo1e) for
more details.

It is built completely on open source, leveraging the QMK Firmware
Toolkit.

Compared to a traditional keyboard, ZeLDA offers the following
improvements:

- minimal reaching for any key for more comfort
- unstaggered grid layout
- a conservative spacebar: seven thumb-reachable keys! (vs 3)
- high quality keys -- it's mechanical!
- tiny desktop footprint

## Instructions

1. Get yourself a Planck (or use something like [QWERKey](https://github.com/MicahElliott/qwerkey) with
   xmodmap/xcape)

1. Install the QMK [prerequisites](https://docs.qmk.fm/build_environment_setup.html).

1. git clone [QMK](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware).

1. `cd qmk_firmware/keyboards/planck/keymaps/` and clone this repo

1. Build/upload with `sudo make CONSOLE_ENABLE=yes debug_enable=true dfu`

1. Tweak `keymap.c` to your heart's content

1. Use xtweak.sh to enable parens on thumbs
